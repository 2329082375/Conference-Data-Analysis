we study the problem of statistically correct inference in network whose basic representation are population code population code are ubiquitous in the brain and involve the simultaneous activity of many unit coding for some low dimensional quantity a classic example are place cell in the rat hippocampus these fire when the animal is at a particular place in an environment so the underlying quantity ha two dimension of spatial location we show how to interpret the activity a encoding whole probability distribution over the underlying variable rather then just single value and propose a method of inductively learning mapping between population code that are computationally tractable and yet offer good approximation to statistically optimal inference we simulate the method on some simple example to prove it competence 
many search tree are impractically large to explore exhaustively recently technique like limited discrepancy search have been proposed for improving the chance of finding a goal in a limited amount of search depth bounded discrepancy search offer such a hope the motivation behind depth bounded discrepancy search is that branching heuristic are more likely to be wrong at the top of the tree than at the bottom we therefore combine one of the best feature of limited discrepancy search the ability to undo early mistake with the completeness of iterative deepening search we show theoretically and experimentally that this novel combination outperforms existing technique

one issue for autonomous mobile robot operating in unknown or partially known domain is how to handle uncertainty in their sensor observation over time method such a probablistic belief network and survivor function are generally unsatisfactory because they require explicit model of the robot s interaction with it environment including possible contravening event this information is difficult to obtain and is philosophically incompatible with reactive behavior this paper present an approach which eliminates the need for explicit model and reasoning instead it relies solely on directly perceivable attribute of the robot object and environment the attribute qualitatively rate whether the robot s current observation are from an inherently more informed state than previous reading e g from a better viewpoint observation from more informed state have different rate for the accrual and attrition of belief than those taken from le informed state this paper describes the implementation focusing on how the information state is computed using fuzzy logic and how the state dynamically adapts a variation of dempster s rule to generate the total belief data from a mobile robot tracking an unknown object demonstrates that the reactive computation of belief over time performs well for six canonical accrual and attrition case

at the heart of many optimization procedure are powerful pruning and propagation rule this paper present a case study in the construction of such rule we develop a new algorithm complete decreasing best fit that find the optimal packing of object into bin the algorithm use a branching rule based on the well known decreasing best fit approximation algorithm in addition it includes a powerful pruning rule derived from a bound on the solution to the remaining subproblem the bound is constructed by using modular arithmetic to decompose the numerical constraint we show that the pruning rule add essentially a constant factor overhead to runtime whilst reducing search significantly on the hardest problem runtime can be reduced by an order of magnitude finally we demonstrate how propagation rule can be built by adding lookahead to pruning rule this general approach optimization procedure built from branching rule based on good approximation algorithm and pruning and propagation rule derived from bound on the remaining subproblem may be effective on other np complete problem

propositional strip planning problem can be viewed a finite state automaton fsas represented in a factored form automaton minimization is a well known technique for reducing the size of an explicit fsa recent work in computer aided verification on model checking ha extended this technique to provide automaton minimization algorithm for factored fsas in this paper we consider the relationship between strip problem solving technique such a regression and the recently developed automaton minimization technique for factored fsas we show that regression computes a partial and approximate minimized form of the fsa corresponding to the strip problem we then define a systematic form of regression which computes a partial but exact minimized form of the associated fsa we also relate minimization to method for performing reachability analysis to detect irrelevant fluents finally we show that exact computation of the minimized automaton is np complete under the assumption that this automaton is polynomial in size

object identification the task of deciding that two observed object are in fact one and the same object is a fundamental requirement for any situated agent that reason about individual object identity a represented by the equality operator between two term in predicate calculus is essentially a first order concept raw sensory observation on the other hand are essentially propositional especially when formulated a evidence in standard probability theory this paper describes pattern of reasoning that allow identity sentence to be grounded in sensory observation thereby bridging the gap we begin by defining a physical event space over which probability are defined we then introduce an identity criterion which selects those event that correspond to identity between observed object from this we are able to compute the probability that any two object are the same given a stream of observation of many object we show that the appearance probability which defines how an object can be expected to appear at subsequent observation given it current appearance is a natural model for this type of reasoning we apply the theory to the task of recognizing car observed by camera at widely separated site in a freeway network with new heuristic to handle the inevitable complexity of matching large number of object and with online learning of appearance probability model despite extremely noisy observation we are able to achieve high level of performance 
in a graph with a small world topology node are highly clustered yet the path length between them is small such a topology can make search problem very difficult since local decision quickly propagate globally we show that graph associated with many different search problem have a small world topology and that the cost of solving such search problem can have a heavy tailed distribution the strategy of randomization and restarts appears to eliminate these heavy tail a novel restart schedule in which the cutoff bound is increased geometrically appears particularly effective

first order logic is the traditional basis for knowledge representation language however it applicability to many real world task is limited by it inability to represent uncertainty bayesian belief network on the other hand are inadequate for complex kr task due to the limited expressivity of the underlying prepositional language the need to incorporate uncertainty into an expressive language ha led to a resurgence of work on first order probabilistic logic this paper address one of the main objection to the incorporation of probability into the language where do the number come from we present an approach that take a knowledge base in an expressive rule based first order language and leams the probabilistic parameter associated with those rule from data case our approach which is based on algorithm for learning in traditional bayesian network can handle data case where many of the relevant aspect of the situation are unobserved it is also capable of utilizing a rich variety of data case including instance with varying causal structure and even involving a varying number of individual these feature allow the approach to be used for a wide range of task such a learning genetic propagation model or learning first order strip planning operator with uncertain effect
