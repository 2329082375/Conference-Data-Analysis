query expansion method have been studied for a long time with debatable success in many instance in this paper we present a probabilistic query expansion model based on a similarity thesaurus which wa constructed automatically a similarity thesaurus reflects domain knowledge about the particular collection from which it is constructed we address the two important issue with query expansion the selection and the weighting of additional search term in contrast to earlier method our query are expanded by adding those term that are most similar to the concept of the query rather than selecting term that are similar to the query term our experiment show that this kind of query expansion result in a notable improvement in the retrieval effectiveness when measured using both recall precision and usefulness 
to summarize is to reduce in complexity and hence in length while retaining some of the essential quality of the original this paper focus on document extract a particular kind of computed document summary 
collection fusion is a data fusion problem in which the result of retrieval run on separate autonomous document collection must be merged to produce a single effective result this paper explores two collection fusion technique that learn the rmrnber of document to retrieve from each collection using only the ranked list of document returned in response to past query and those document relevance judgment retrieval experiment using the trec test co lection demonstrate that the effectiveness of the fusion technique is within of the effectiveness of a run in which the entire set of document is treated a a single collection 
in recent publication about data compression arithmetic code are often suggested asthe state of the art rather than the more popular huffman code while it is true that huffmancodes are not optimal in all situation we show that the advantage of arithmetic code in compressionperformance is often negligible referring also to other criterion we conclude that for many application huffman code should still remain a competitive choice introductionit is paradoxical that a the 
our analysis combine the concern of signature extraction and signature file organization which have usually been treated a separate issue we also relax the uniform frequency and single term query assumption and provide a comprehensive analysis for multiterm query environment where term can be classified based on their query and database occurrence frequency the performance of three superimposed signature generation scheme is explored a they are applied to one dynamic signature file organization based on linear hashing linear hashing with superimposed signature lh first scheme sm allows all term set the same number of bit regardless of their discriminatory power whereas the second and third method mm and mmm emphasize the term with high query and low database occurrence frequency of these three scheme only mmm take the probability distribution of the number of query term into account in finding the optimal mapping strategy derivation of performance evaluation formula is provided together with the result of various experimental setting suggestion a to how to implement the given technique in real life case are also provided result indicate that mmm outperforms the other method a the gap between the discriminatory power of the term get larger the absolute value of the saving provided by mmm reach a maximum for the high query weight case however the extra saving decline sharply for high weight and moderately for the low weight query with the increase in database size 
this paper describes an automatic indexing procedure that us the is a relation contained within wordnet and the set of noun contained in a text to select a sense for each plysemous noun in the text the result of the indexing procedure is a vector in which some of the term represent word sens instead of word stem retrieval experiment comparing the effectivenss of these sense based vector v stem based vector show the stem based vector to be superior overall although the sense based vector do improve the performance of some query the overall degradation is due in large part to the difficulty of disambiguating sens in short query statement an analysis of these result suggests two conclusion the is a link define a generalization specialization hierarchy that is not sufficient to reliably select the correct sense of a noun from the set of fine sense distinction in wordnet and missing correct match because of incorrect sense resolution ha a much more deleterious effect on retrieval performance than doe making spurious match 
we argue that the advent of large volume of full length text a opposed to short text like abstract and newswire should be accompanied by corresponding new approach to information access toward this end we discus the merit of imposing structure on full length text document that is a partition of the text into coherent multi paragraph unit that represent the pattern of subtopics that comprise the text using this structure we can make a distinction between the main topic which occur throughout the length of the text and the subtopics which are of only limited extent we discus why recognition of subtopic structure is important and how to some degree of accuracy it can be found we describe a new way of specifying query on full length document and then describe an experiment in which making use of the recognition of local structure achieves better result on a typical information retrieval task than doe a standard ir measure 
plausible inference is an essential aspect of logic based information disclosure this paper proposes a context sensitive plausible inference mechanism based on a so called index expression belief network plausible inference is cloaked a probabilistic evidence propagation within this network preliminary experiment show general evidence propagation algorithm to be too inefficient for real life information disclosure application the paper sketch two optimization whereby efficient special purpose evidence propagation may be realized 
the pile is a new element of the desktop user interface metaphor designed to support the casual organization of document an interface design based on the pile concept suggested us of content awareness for describing organizing and filing textual document we describe a prototype implementation of these capability and give a detailed example of how they might appear to the user we believe the system demonstrates how content awareness can be not only used in a computer filing system but made an integral part of the user s experience 
abstract ithas often been thought that word sense ambiguity is a cause of poor performance in information retrieval ir system the belief is that if ambiguous word can be correctly disambiguated ir performance will increase however recent research into the application of a word sense disambiguator to an ir system failed toshow any performance increase from these result it ha become clear that more basic research is needed to investigate the relationship between sense ambiguity disambiguation and ir using a technique that introduces additional sense ambiguity into a collection this paper present research 
most information retrieval system use stopword list and stemming algorithm however we have found that recognizing singular and plural noun verb form negation and preposition can produce dramatically different text classification result we present result from text classification experiment that compare relevancy signature which use local linguistic context with corresponding indexing term that do not in two different domain relevancy signature produced better result than the simple indexing term these experiment suggest that stopword list and stemming algorithm may remove or conflate many word that could be used to create more effective indexing term 
relevance feedbacvk with too much data a uma technical report james allan ir ref tr modern text collection often contain large document which span several subject area such document are problematic for relevance feedback since inappropriate term can easily be chosen this study explores the highly effective approach of feeding back passage of large document a lessexpensive method which discard long document is also reviewed and found to be effective if there are enough relevant document a hybrid approach which feed back short document and passage of long document may be the best compromise 
since we have investigated the problem and possibility of applying modern information retrieval method to large online public access library catalog opacs in the retrieval experiment virginia tech online catalog revtolc study we carried out a large pilot test in and a larger controlled investigation in with user and roughly marc record result indicated that a form based interface coupled with vector and relevance feedback retrieval method would be well received recent effort developing the multiple access and retrieval of information with annotation marian system have involved used of a specially developed object oriented dbms construction of a client running under nextstep programming of a distributed server with a thread assigned to each user session to increase concurrency on a small network of nexts refinement of algorithm to use object and stopping rule for greater efficiency usability testing and iterative interface refinement 
it ha been known that using different representation of either query or document or different retrieval technique retrieves different set of document recent work suggests that significant improvement in retrieval performance can be achieved by combining multiple representation or multiple retrieval technique in this paper we propose a simple method for retrieving different document within a single query representation a single document representation and a single retrieval technique we classify the type of document and describe the property of weighting scheme then we explain that different property of weighting scheme may retrieve different type of document experimental result show that significant improvement can be obtained by combining the retrieval result from different property of weighting scheme 
the scatter gather document browsing method us fast document clustering to produce table of content like outline of large document collection previous work developed linear time document clustering algorithm to establish the feasibility of this method over moderately large collection however even linear time algorithm are too slow to support interactive browsing of very large collection such a tipster the darpa standard text retrieval evaluation collection we present a scheme that support constant interaction time scatter gather of arbitrarily large collection after near linear time preprocessing this involves the construction of a cluster hierarchy a modification of scatter gather employing this scheme and an example of it use over the tipster collection are presented 
in this paper a probabilistic relational model is presented which combine relational algebra with probabilistic retrieval based on certain independence assumption the operator of the relational algebra are redefined such that the probabilistic algebra is a generalization of the standard relational algebra furthermore a special join operator implementing probabilistic retrieval is proposed when applied to typical document database query can not only ask for document but for any kind of object in the database in addition an implicit ranking of these object is provided in case the query relates to probabilistic indexing or us the probabilistic join operator the proposed algebra is intended a a standard interface to combined database and ir system a a basis for implementing user friendly interface 
the retrieval model based on the extended boolean retrieval framework e g the fuzzy set model and the extended boolean model have been proposed in the past to provide the conventional boolean retrieval system with the document ranking facility however due to undesirable property of evaluation formula for the and and or operation the former generates incorrect ranked output in certain case and the latter suffers from the complexity of computation there have been a variety of fuzzy operator to replace the evaluation formula in this paper we first investigate the behavioral aspect of the fuzzy operator and address important issue to affect retrieval effectiveness we then define an operator class called positively compensatory operator giving high retrieval effectiveness and present a pair of positively compensatory operator providing high retrieval efficiency a well a high retrieval effectiveness all the claim are justified through experiment 
in this paper a bayesian inference network model for automatic indexing with index term descriptor from a prescribed vocabulary is presented it requires an indexing dictionary with rule mapping term of the respective subject field onto descriptor and inverted list for term occuring in a set of document of the subject field and descriptor manually assigned to these document the indexing dictionary can be derived automatically from a set of manually indexed document an application of the network model is described followed by an indexing example and some experimental result about the indexing performance of the network model 
an application of mathematical lattice theory called relationship lattice is utilized to attack problem of operational bibliographic information retrieval the proposed solution offer an interface to the information searcher enabling operation in a world of concept author and document record and their relationship this hide the complexity of query language and database structure and it allows to use a personally preferred terminology and to browse query and download document record in a convenient way the main component of the proposed solution is a personal thesaurus built up a a relationship lattice 
identifying node of information that are highly related ha many application in any information system and in particular in hypertext system in this paper we present a technique to identify natural cluster in a hypertext a natural cluster is a cluster that is not arbitrary but depends only on intrinsic property of the hypertext in our case the property we will use to identify the cluster is the number of independent path between node using the graph theoretic definition of k edge component we present an aggregation technique to cluster the node we then use this technique to cluster three medium sized hypertext that were developed by different author for different user using different methodology we also show how to use clustering to improve data display browsing and retrieval 
relevance feedback which modifies query using judgement of the relevance of a few highly ranked document ha historically been an important method for increasing the performance of information retrieval system in this paper we extend the inference network model introduced by turtle and croft to include relevance feedback technique the difference between relevance feedback on text abstract and full text collection is studied preliminary result for relevance feedback on the structured query supported by the inference net model are also reported 
structured text for example dictionary and user manual typically have a heirarchical tree like structure we describe a query language for retrieving information from collection of hierarchical text the language is based on a tree pattern matching notion called tree inclusion tree inclusion allows easy expression of query that use the structure and the content of the document in using it a user need not be aware of the whole structure of the database thus a language based on tree inclusion is data independent a property made necessary because of the great variance in the structure of the text 
we find that dissemination of collection wide information cwi in a distributed collection of document is needed to achieve retrieval effectiveness comparable to a centralized collection complete dissemination is unnecessary the required dissemination level depends upon how document are allocated among site low dissemination is needed for random document allocation but higher level are needed when document are allocated based on content we define parameter to control dissemination and document allocation and present result from four test collection we define the notion of iso knowledge line with respect to the number of site and level of dissemination in the distributed archive and show empirically that iso knowledge line are also iso effectiveness line when document are randomly allocated 
robust linguistic method are applied to the task of answering closed class question using a corpus of natural language the method are illustrated in a broad domain answering general knowledge question using an on line encyclopedia a closed class question is a question stated in natural language which assumes some definite answer typified by a noun phrase rather than a procedural answer the method hypothesize noun phrase that are likely to be the answer and present the user with relevant text in which they are marked focussing the user s attention appropriately furthermore the sentence of matching text that are shown to the user are selected to confirm phrase relation implied by the question rather than being selected solely on the basis of word frequency the corpus is accessed via an information retrieval ir system that support boolean search with proximity constraint query are automatically constructed from the phrasal content of the question and passed to the ir system to find relevant text then the relevant text is itself analyzed noun phrase hypothesis are extracted and new query are independently made to confirm phrase relation for the various hypothesis the method are currently being implemented in a system called murax and although this process is not complete it is sufficiently advanced for an interim evaluation to be presented 
automatic abstracting typically based on extraction of important sentence from a text ha been treated a a largely separate task from automatic indexing this paper describes an approach in which the indexing and abstracting task are effectively combined it is applicable to highly structured empirical research paper whose content can be organised using a semantic frame during a scan of a source text stylistic clue and construct are used for extracting candidate filler for the various slot in the frame subsequently an actual concept name is chosen for each slot by comparing the various candidate and their weight 
abstract information filtering system have potential power that may provide an efficient mean of navigating through large and diverse data space however current information filtering technology heavily depends on a user s active participation for describing the user s interest to information item forcing the user to accept extra load to overcome thealready loaded situation fumhemo because theuser s interest weoften expressed indiscrete fomat such a a set of keywords sometimes augmented with if then rule it is difficult to express ambiguous interest which user often want to do we propose a technique that us user behavior monitonng to transparently capture the user sinterest in information andatechnique to use this interest to fikerincoming information in avery efficient way the proposed technique are verified to perform very well by having conducted a field experiment and a series of simulation 
this paper describes a new indexing method for japanese text database using the simple keyword string in which a compound word is treated a a string of simple word which are the smallest unit in japanese grammar which still maintain their meaning this method allows retrieved text to be ranked according to the similarity of their meaning to the query without using a control vocabulary or thesaurus this paper also introduces the keyword feature which describes the syntactic and semantic characteristic of a word and result in more precise keyword extraction and text retrieval a well a simple dictionary maintenance 
the standard strategy for evaluation based on precision and recall are examined and their relative advantage and disadvantage are discussed in particular it is suggested that relevance feedback be evaluated from the perspective of the user a number of different statistical test are described for determining if difference in performance between retrieval method are significant these test have often been ignored in the past because most are based on an assumption of normality which is not strictly valid for the standard performance measure however one can test this assumption using simple diagnostic plot and if it is a poor approximation there are a number of non parametric alternative 
text categorization can be viewed a a process of category search in which one or more category for a test document are searched for by using given training document with known category a cluster based search with a probabilistic clustering algorithm is proposed and evaluated on two data set the efficiency effectiveness and noise tolerance of this search strategy were confirmed to be better than those of a full search a category based search and a cluster based search with nonprobabilistic clustering 
there ha been a great deal of interest within the information retrieval community in evaluating the use of linguistic knowledge to improve the indexing and searching of textual database such system must often employ a lexicon to store information about the word and phrase comprising the application s domain unlike a static lexicon a dynamic lexicon raise practical concern about the coordination between the state of the lexicon and ir indexing scheme based on lexical knowledge additionally it introduces a host of database management issue many of which are similar to those found in the text database a well in this paper we explore a range of system design and performance issue that arise when integrating a dynamic lexicon with a dynamic full text information retrieval system we observe that the principle of functional isolation argues against the use of language dependent information in article index and favor the use of query time strategy for applying lexical knowledge we propose and evaluate a system architecture which embodies this principle we also show how a storage and retrieval infrastructure based on burkowski s burkowski containment model abstraction can be employed to implement both the text retrieval and lexicon facility required in an integrated system 
the access structure the retrieval model and the system architecture of the spider information retrieval system are described the access structure provides efficient weighted retrieval on dynamic data collection it is based on signature and non inverted item description the signature provide upper bound for the exact retrieval status value such that only a small number of exact retrieval status value have to be computed spider s retrieval model is a probabilistic retrieval model that is capable to exploit the database scheme of semistructured data collection this model can be considred a a further development of the binary independence indexing bii model the system architecture wa derived systematically from a given set of requirement such a effective and efficient retrieval on dynamic data collection exploitation of the database scheme computed view and the integration of information retrieval functionality and database functionality 
morphology is the area of linguistics concerned with the internal structure of word information retrieval ha generally not paid much attention to word structure other than to account for some of the variability in word form via the use of stemmer this paper will describe our experiment to determine the importance of morphology and the effect that it ha on performance we will also describe the role of morphological analysis in word sense disambiguation and in identifying lexical semantic relationship in a machine readable dictionary we will first provide a brief overview of morphological phenomenon and then describe the experiment themselves 
information retrieval system are being challenged to managelarger and larger document collection in an effort to providebetter retrieval performance on large collection moresophisticated retrieval technique have been developed that supportrich structured query structured query are not amenable topreviously proposed optimization technique optimizing execution however is even more important in the context of large documentcollections we present a new structured query optimizationtechnique which we have implemented in an inference network basedinformation retrieval system experimental result show that queryevaluation time can be reduced by more than half with little impacton retrieval effectiveness 
this paper describes a unique example based mapping method for document retrieval we discovered that the knowledge about relevance among query and document can be used to obtain empirical connection between query term and the canonical concept which are used for indexing the content of document these connection do not depend on whether there are shared term among the query and document therefore they are especially effective for a mapping from query to the document where the concept are relevant but the term used by article author happen to be different from the term of database user we employ a linear least square fit llsf technique to compute such connection from a collection of query and document where the relevance is assigned by human and then use these connection in the retrieval of document where the relevance is unknown we tested this method on both retrieval and indexing with a set of medline document which ha been used by other information retrieval system for evaluation the effectiveness of the llsf mapping and the significant improvement over alternative approach wa evident in the test
