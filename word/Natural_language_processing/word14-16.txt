the phealth conference is the th in a series of scientific event bringing together expertise from medical technological political administrative and social domain and even from philosophy or linguistics it open a new chapter in the success story of the series of international conference on wearable or implantable micro and nano technology for personalized medicine by presenting keynote invited talk oral presentation and short poster presentation provided by close to author from country from various part of the world starting in with personal health management system phealth conference have evolved to truly interdisciplinary and global event by covering technological and biomedical facility legal ethical social and organizational requirement and impact a well a necessary basic research for enabling future proof care paradigm thereby it combine medical service with public health prevention social and elderly care wellness and personal fitness to establish participatory predictive personalized preventive and effective care setting by this way it ha attracted scientist developer and practitioner from various technology medical and health discipline legal affair politics and administration from all over the world the conference brought together health service vendor and provider institution payer organization governmental department academic institution

technology for all stakeholder community including patient citizen health professional politician healthcare establishment and company from the biomedical technology pharmaceutical and telecommunication domain give enormous potential not only for medical quality improvement and industrial competitiveness but also for managing health care cost the phealth conference thankfully benefit from the experience and the lesson learned from the organizing committee of previous phealth event particularly in oslo in berlin in lyon in porto in tallinn and vienna the conference brought up the interesting idea of having special session focusing on a particular topic and being organized by a mentor moderator the berlin event in initiated workshop on particular topic prior to the official kick off of the conference lyon in initiated the launch of socalled dynamic demonstration allowing the participant to dynamically show software and hardware solution on the fly without needing a booth implementing preconference event the phealth in porto gave attendee a platform for presenting and discussing recent development and provocative idea that helped to animate the session highlight of phealth in tallinn wa the special session on european project success story but also presentation on the newest paradigm change and challenge coming up with big data analytics translational and nano medicine etc vienna in focused on lesson learned from international and national r amp d activity and practical solution and especially from the new eu framework program for research and innovation horizon beside report about technology transfer support and building ecosystem and value chain to ensure better time to market and higher impact of knowledge based technology the acceptability of solution especially considering security and privacy aspect have been presented and deeply discussed the phealth conference address mobile technology knowledge driven application and computer assisted decision support but also apps designed to support elderly a well a chronic patient in their daily and possibly independent living invited contribution consider fundamental scientific and methodological challenge of adaptive autonomous and intelligent phealth approach the new role of patient a consumer and active party with growing autonomy and related responsibility but also requirement and solution for mhealth in lowand medium income country it aim at sharing experience and result and opening up for the future the phealth presentation are complemented by demonstration of practical artifact and solution a well a by a student poster competition more insight in the phealth challenge are provided by a satellite conference of novamedtech embedded sensor

a novel method to induce wide coverage combinatory categorial grammar ccg resource for japanese is proposed in this article for some language including english the availability of large annotated corpus and the development of data based induction of lexicalized grammar have enabled deep parsing i e parsing based on lexicalized grammar however deep parsing for japanese ha not been widely studied this is mainly because most japanese syntactic resource are represented in chunk based dependency structure while previous method for inducing grammar are dependent on tree corpus to translate syntactic information presented in chunk based dependency to phrase structure a accurately a possible integration of annotation from multiple dependency based corpus is proposed our method first integrates dependency structure and predicate argument information and convert them into phrase structure tree the tree are then transformed into ccg derivation in a similar way to previously proposed method the quality of the conversion is empirically evaluated in term of the coverage of the obtained ccg lexicon and the accuracy of the parsing with the grammar while the transforming process used in this study is specialized for japanese the framework of our method would be applicable to other language for which dependency based analysis ha been regarded a more appropriate than phrase structure based analysis due to morphosyntactic feature 
a word s sentiment depends on the domain in which it is used computational social science research thus requires sentiment lexicon that are specific to the domain being studied we combine domain specific word embeddings with a label propagation framework to induce accurate domain specific sentiment lexicon using small set of seed word we show that our approach achieves state of the art performance on inducing sentiment lexicon from domain specific corpus and that our purely corpus based approach outperforms method that rely on hand curated resource e g wordnet using our framework we induce and release historical sentiment lexicon for year of english and community specific sentiment lexicon for online community from the social medium forum reddit the historical lexicon we induce show that more than of sentiment bearing non neutral english word completely switched polarity during the last year and the community specific lexicon highlight how sentiment varies drastically between different community
