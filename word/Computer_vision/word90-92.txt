model based recognition method generally search for geometrically consistent pair of model and image feature the quality of an hypothesis is then measured using some function of the number of model feature that are paired with image feature the most common approach is to simply count the number of pair of consistent model and image feature however this may yield a large number of feature pair due to a single model feature being consistent with several image feature and vice versa a better quality measure is provided by the size of a maximal bipartite matching which eliminates the multiple counting of a given feature computing such a matching is computationally expensive but under certain condition it is well approximated by the number of distinct feature consistent with a given hypothesis

an intensity reflectance model is proposed for diffuse reflection originating from subsurface multiple scattering within inhomogeneous dielectric material one of the most common assumption in computer vision from inhomogeneous dielectric is lambertian the proposed model utilizes the subsurface intensity distribution predicted by modeling subsurface multiple scattering based upon radiative transfer theory for an optically smooth surface boundary this subsurface intensity distribution becomes altered by fresnel attenuation upon refraction into air making it become significantly non lambertian this resulting intensity distribution serf a a reflection law for individual optically smooth microfacets that compose an opaque rough surface producing a physical unification of diffuse reflection with the torrance sparrow specular reflection model experimental result that verify the accuracy of the model are presented a relatively simple formula that approximates closely the true behaviour of diffuse reflection and can be used in place of a lambertian term is presented the non lambertian nature of the diffuse component becomes most significant near occluding contour and sometimes produce a previously unnoticed intensity effect that can aid in their detection 
full perspective mapping between d object and d image are more complicated than weak perspective mapping which consider only rotation translation and scaling therefore in d model based robot navigation it is important to understand how and when full perspective must be taken into account a probabilistic combinatorial optimization algorithm is used to search for an optimal match between d landmark and d image feature three variation are considered a weak perspective algorithm rotates translates and scale an initial d projection of the d landmark a full perspective selects a most promising alternative but then update the pose and reprojects the landmark like the full perspective algorithm the hybrid algorithm reliably recovers the true pose of the robot and like the weak perspective algorithm it run to faster than the full perspective algorithm
