there is a growing interest in intelligent assistant for a variety of application from sorting email to helping people with disability to do their daily chore in this paper we formulate the problem of intelligent assistance in a decision theoretic framework and present both theoretical and empirical result we first introduce a class of pomdps called hidden goal mdps hgmdps which formalizes the problem of interactively assisting an agent whose goal is hidden and whose action are observable in spite of it restricted nature we show that optimal action selection for hgmdps is pspace complete even for deterministic dynamic we then introduce a more restricted model called helper action mdps hamdps which are sufficient for modeling many real world problem we show class of hamdps for which efficient algorithm are possible more interestingly for general hamdps we show that a simple myopic policy achieves a near optimal regret compared to an oracle assistant that know the agent s goal we then introduce more sophisticated version of this policy for the general case of hgmdps that we combine with a novel approach for quickly learning about the agent being assisted we evaluate our approach in two game like computer environment where human subject perform task and in a real world domain of providing assistance during folder navigation in a computer desktop environment the result show that in all three domain the framework result in an assistant that substantially reduces user effort with only modest computation 
sustainable energy system of the future could no longer rely on the current paradigm that energy supply follows demand since many of the renewable energy resource do not produce power on demand there is a need for new market structure that motivate sustainable behavior by participant the power trading agent competition power tac is a new annual competition that focus on the design and operation of future retail power market specifically in smart grid environment with renewable energy production smart metering and autonomous agent acting on behalf of customer and retailer it us a rich open source simulation platform that is based on real world data and state of the art customer model it purpose is to help researcher understand the dynamic of customer and retailer decision making a well a the robustness of proposed market design this research contributes to the former by introducing tactex the champion agent from the inaugural competition in tactex learns and adapts to the environment in which it operates by heavily relying on reinforcement learning and prediction method we formalize the complex decision making problem that tactex face and approximate it solution in tactex s constituent component we examine the success of the complete agent through analysis of competition result 
team of mobile robot often need to divide up subtasks efficiently in spatial domain a key criterion for doing so may depend on distance between robot and the subtasks location this research considers a specific such criterion namely how to assign interchangeable robot to a set of target location such that the makespan time for all robot to reach their target location is minimized while also preventing collision among robot we provide an overview of a scalable multiagent dynamic role assignment system known a scram scalable collision avoiding role assignment with minimal makespan scram us a graph theoretic approach to map agent to target location such that our objective for both minimizing the makespan and avoiding agent collision are met scram scale to thousand of agent a role assignment algorithm run in polynomial time

reducing energy consumption of climate control system is important in order to reduce human environmental foot print we consider a method for an automated agent to provide advice to driver which will motivate them to reduce the energy consumption of their climate control unit our approach take into account both the energy consumption of the climate control system and the expected comfort level of the driver we therefore build two model one for assessing the energy consumption of the climate control system a a function of the system s setting and the other model human comfort level a a function of the climate control system s setting using these model the agent provides advice to the driver considering how to set the climate control system the agent advises setting which try to preserve a high level of comfort while consuming a little energy a possible we empirically show that driver equipped with our agent which provides them with advice signicantly save energy a compared to driver not equipped with our agent 
an important task in the analysis of multiagent system is to understand how group of selfish player can form coalition i e work together in team in this paper we study the dynamic of coalition formation under bounded rationality we consider setting where each team s profit is given by a concave function and propose three profit sharing scheme each of which is based on the concept of marginal utility the agent are assumed to be myopic i e they keep changing team a long a they can increase their payoff by doing so we study the property such a closeness to nash equilibrium or total profit of the state that result after a polynomial number of such move and prove bound on the price of anarchy and the price of stability of the corresponding game 
researcher have introduced the dynamic distributed constraint optimization problem dynamic dcop formulation to model dynamically changing multi agent coordination problem where a dynamic dcop is a sequence of static canonical dcops each partially different from the dcop preceding it existing work typically assumes that the problem in each time step is decoupled from the problem in other time step which might not hold in some application in this paper we introduce a new model called markovian dynamic dcops md dcops where a dcop is a function of the value assignment in the preceding dcop we also introduce a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm that balance exploration and exploitation to solve md dcops in an online manner 
realistic multi agent team application often feature dynamic environment with soft deadline that penalize late execution of task this put a premium on quickly allocating task to agent but finding the optimal allocation is np hard because task must be executed sequentially by agent we propose a novel task allocation algorithm that find allocation that are fair envy free balancing the load and sharing important task between agent and efficient pareto optimal by using a fisher market based on a simplified problem model such allocation can be easily sequenced to yield high quality solution a shown empirically on problem inspired by real police log

we analyze symmetric protocol to rationally coordinate on an asymmetric efficient allocation in an infinitely repeated n agent c resource allocation problem where the resource are all homogeneous bhaskar proposed one way to achieve this in agent resource game agent start by symmetrically randomizing their action and a soon a they each choose different action they start to follow a potentially asymmetric convention that prescribes their action from then on we extend the concept of convention to the general case of infinitely repeated resource allocation game with n agent and c resource we show that for any convention there exists a symmetric subgameperfect equilibrium which implement it we present two convention bourgeois where agent stick to the first allocation and market where agent pay for the use of resource and observe a global coordination signal which allows them to alternate between different allocation we define price of anonymity of a convention a a ratio between the maximum social payoff of any asymmetric strategy profile and the expected social payoff of the subgame perfect equilibrium which implement the convention we show that while the price of anonymity of the bourgeois convention is infinite the market convention decrease this price by reducing the conflict between the agent 
conformity influence is the inclination of a person to be influenced by others in this paper we study how the conformity tendency of a person change with her role a defined by her structural property in a social network we first formalize conformity influence using a utility function based on the conformity theory from social psychology and then propose a proba bilistic graphical model referred to a role conformity model rcm for modeling the role aware conformity influence between user by incorporating the utility function we apply the proposed rcm to several academic research network and discover that people with higher degree and lower clustering coefficient are more likely to conform to others we also evaluate rcm through the task of word usage prediction in academic publication and show significant improvement over baseline model 
in machine learning and statistic probabilistic inference involving multimodal distribution is quite difficult this is especially true in high dimensional problem where most existing algorithm cannot easily move from one mode to another to address this issue we propose a novel bayesian inference approach based on markov chain monte carlo our method can effectively sample from multimodal distribution especially when the dimension is high and the mode are isolated to this end it exploit and modifies the riemannian geometric property of the target distribution to create wormhole connecting mode in order to facilitate moving between them further our proposed method us the regeneration technique in order to adapt the algorithm by identifying new mode and updating the network of wormhole without affecting the stationary distribution to find new mode a opposed to redis covering those previously identified we employ a novel mode searching algorithm that explores a residual energy function obtained by subtracting an approximate gaussian mixture density based on previously discovered mode from the target density function 
linear dynamical system lds is an elegant mathematical framework for modeling and learning multivariate time series mt however in general it is difficult to set the dimension of an lds s hidden state space a small number of hidden state may not be able to model the complexity of a mt while a large number of hidden state can lead to overfitting in this paper we study learning method that impose various regularization penalty on the transition matrix of the lds model and propose a regularized lds learning framework rlds which aim to automatically shut down ldss spurious and unnecessary dimension and consequently address the problem of choosing the optimal number of hidden state prevent the overfitting problem given a small amount of mt data and support accurate mt forecasting to learn the regularized lds from data we incorporate a second order cone program and a generalized gradient descent method into the maximum a posteriori framework and use expectation maximization to obtain a low rank transition matrix of the lds model we propose two prior for modeling the matrix which lead to two instance of our rlds we show that our rlds is able to recover well the intrinsic dimensionality of the time series dynamic and it improves the predictive performance when compared to baseline on both synthetic and real world mt datasets 
in the proposed thesis we study distributed constraint optimization problem dcops which are problem where several agent coordinate with each other to optimize a global cost function the use of dcops ha gained momentum due to their capability of addressing complex and naturally distributed problem however the adoption of dcop on large problem face two main limitation modeling limitation a current resolution method detach the model from the resolution process assuming that each agent control a single variable of the problem and solving capability a the inability of current approach to capitalize on the presence of structural information which may allow incoherent unnecessary data to reticulate among the agent a well a to exploit structure of the agent s local problem the purpose of the proposed dissertation is to address such limitation studying how to adapt and integrate insight gained from centralized solving technique in order to enhance dcop performance and scalability enabling their use for the resolution of real world complex problem to do so we hypothesize that one can exploit the dcop structure in both problem modeling and problem resolution phase 
we present saul a new probabilistic programming language designed to address some of the shortcoming of programming language that aim at advancing and simplifying the development of ai system such language need to interact with messy naturally occurring data to allow a programmer to specify what need to be done at an appropriate level of abstraction rather than at the data level to be developed on a solid theory that support moving to and reasoning at this level of abstraction and finally to support flexible integration of these learning and inference model within an application program saul is an object functional programming language written in scala that facilitates these by allowing a programmer to learn name and manipulate named abstraction over relational data supporting seamless incorporation of trainable probabilistic or discriminative component into the program and providing a level of inference over trainable model to support composition and make decision that respect domain and application constraint saul is developed over a declaratively defined relational data model can use piecewise learned factor graph with declaratively specified learning and inference objective and it support inference over probabilistic model augmented with declarative knowledge based constraint we describe the key construct of saul and exemplify it use in developing application that require relational feature engineering and structured output prediction

random forest are one type of the most effective ensemble learning method in spite of their sound empirical performance the study on their theoretical property ha been left far behind recently several random forest variant with nice theoretical basis have been proposed but they all suffer from poor empirical performance in this paper we propose a bernoulli random forest model brf which intends to close the gap between the theoretical consistency and the empirical soundness of random forest classification compared to breiman s original random forest brf make two simplification in tree construction by using two independent bernoulli distribution the first bernoulli distribution is used to control the selection of candidate attribute for each node of the tree and the second one control the splitting point used by each node a a result brf enjoys proved theoretical consistency so it accuracy will converge to optimum i e the bayes risk a the training data grow infinitely large empirically brf demonstrates the best performance among all theoretical random forest and is very comparable to breiman s original random forest which do not have the proved consistency yet the theoretical and experimental study advance the research one step further towards closing the gap between the theory and the practical performance of random forest classification
